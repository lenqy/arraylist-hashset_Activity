# Java Activity

2022/09/26 Activity

This activity will be about ArrayList, HashSet, and HashMap implementation.

1st Activity

1. implement an ArrayList and HashSet
2. Ask for user input 5 times, and then add the values into the ArrayList and HashSet
3. Display the values in the arraylist and HashSet.
4. Create repository for github and push the code.

2nd Activity

1. Create a program that will continuously ask the user for a selection (menu). Implement these in ArrayList, HashSet, and HashMap implementation
        A. Add number - adds a number to the list/set/map
        B. Remove number - removes a number from the list/set/map
        C. Display numbers - display the numbers added to the list/set/map
        D. Clear numbers - clears the contents added to the list/set/map
        E. Exit

2. Add conditions depending on the implementation of the program

ArrayList: if the added number is negative, don't allow adding the number and display a message.

HashSet: If the added number is already present on the HashSet, don't allow adding the number and display a message.

HashMap: If the added number is a prime number, don't allow adding the number and display a message.
