# Java Activity

2022/09/26 Activity

This activity will be about ArrayList, HashSet, and HashMap implementation.

1st Activity

1. implement an ArrayList and HashSet
2. Ask for user input 5 times, and then add the values into the ArrayList and HashSet
3. Display the values in the arraylist and HashSet.
4. Create repository for github and push the code.

2nd Activity

1. Create a program that will continuously ask the user for a selection (menu). Implement these in ArrayList, HashSet, and HashMap implementation
        A. Add number - adds a number to the list/set/map
        B. Remove number - removes a number from the list/set/map
        C. Display numbers - display the numbers added to the list/set/map
        D. Clear numbers - clears the contents added to the list/set/map
        E. Exit

2. Add conditions depending on the implementation of the program

ArrayList: if the added number is negative, don't allow adding the number and display a message.

HashSet: If the added number is already present on the HashSet, don't allow adding the number and display a message.

HashMap: If the added number is a prime number, don't allow adding the number and display a message.

Create a git repository (individual) and push your code into the repository. The repository should contain 2 files for activity-1 and 3 files for activity-2(1 for ArrayList, 1 for HashSet, 1 for HashMap) . Submit your repository link here.


2022/10/05 Activity

Continue with the activity from Monday. Use the same repository.

1. Create a class with at least 2 properties, and also your own Exception class.
2. In the Main Class, there will be a number input that will ask the user how many objects to create.
3. Put the objects inside an array of objects created, you can use ArrayList and use the class that you created as the object.
4. Ask for user input for the values of the properties (ex. Name, Age for Person class). All the objects created must have values.
5. Think of two scenarios to prevent and implement  try catch. (ex. Name should be string or should not contain special characters etc.)
